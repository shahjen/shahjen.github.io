I am a Master's student at the Oden Institute for Computational Science and Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin.
In the past, I worked as a Quantitative Researcher at Alphagrep Securities, Quantitative Strat  at Goldman Sachs in the Prime Portfolio Strats department and as a Quantitative Researcher at Trexquant Investments LLP.
I earned my Bachelor’s and Master’s of Technology in Energy Science and Engineering from IIT Bombay in 2019. My interests lie in the field of computational simulations. I also have developed an interest in programming and finance over my professional career.
