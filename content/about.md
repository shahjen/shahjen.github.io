I am a Master’s student at the Oden Institute for Computational Science and Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. In the past, I worked as a Quantitative Researcher at Alphagrep Securities, Quantitative Strat at Goldman Sachs in the Prime Portfolio Strats department and as a Quantitative Researcher at Trexquant Investments LLP.

I earned my Bachelor’s and Master’s of Technology in Energy Science and Engineering from IIT Bombay in 2019. My interests lie in the field of computational simulations used in electorchemistry and battery related applications. I have also developed an interest in programming and finance over my professional career.
