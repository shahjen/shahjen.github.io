I worked at [Alphagrep Securities'](https://www.alpha-grep.com) Boson team as a Quantitative Researcher from April - August 2023. My team was based out of the Bangalore office.

My work involved research and development in execution alpha. I used Python, C++ and some bash to implement ideas.

I primarily worked in implementing efficient algorithms that improved the execution performance of trading strategies by reducing slippage. I also wrote a framework in C++ to calculate and realize the VWAP (volume weighted average price) for a ticker.
