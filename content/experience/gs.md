I was hired as an Analyst, and swiftly promoted to Associate in the Prime Portfolio Strats team of Goldman Sachs. My work involved enhancing and maintaining the Prime Services margin model to appropriately assess client risk. Following is the list of the projects I delivered on, along with a brief description:

- **Warrant Pricing** :  I made a marked improvement over the deskâ€™s warrant pricing model and solved the inflated delta issues in client portfolios that caused incorrectly large warrant margins.
- **Delta Liquidation** :  Computed a more accurate and robust liquidation charge for non one-delta products. 
- **Margin Attribution framework** :  Created a client, scenario and position level breakdown of margin to show contribution of a position at different levels, along with the dominant scenario at each level. This not only created transparency for client margining, but gave us really good insights into client risk.
- **Price Reconciliation Report** :  A report to compare desk model prices, margin model input prices and external prices, and flag and report any discrepancy. Investigated various systematic pricing issues and pushed fixes for them.

Apart from these, we also spent some time investigating and analyzing daily production issues, and thematic firedrills for macroeconomic events.
