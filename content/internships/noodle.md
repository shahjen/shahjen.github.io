Internship at [Noodle.ai](https://noodle.ai/)'s Bengaluru office as a Software Engineer. I primarily worked on ensuring robust machine learning pipelines including but not limited to:
- Built a Python framework for testing & validation of data through a machine learning pipeline
- Initiated unit testing frameworks for data cleaning, inferring statistical distributions of incoming data

I was able to integrate my work in existing modules, that resulted in both time savings and a more robust data stream.
