I will be working on the DCE MSOT Image Reconstruction Project with [Prof Umberto Villa](https://uvilla.github.io/) in the spring semester of 2024. 

The broad objective of this proposal is to develop novel and advanced computational and mathematical models to accurately estimate tumor perfusion rates from DCE MSOT images. The proposed methods will be assessed using retrospective DCE MSOT imaging data from a large cohort of mice undergoing radiotherapy.

Briefly:

- We will utilise matrix/tensor algorithms to denoise DCE MSOT images
- We will try to extend the two-compartment linear standard model (**2C-LSM,** Hupple et al 2018) to account for tumor heterogenity
