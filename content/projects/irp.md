I am working on Low rank tensor methods for efficient computational image reconstruction with [Prof Umberto Villa](https://uvilla.github.io/).

The broad objective of this work is to develop novel and advanced computational and mathematical models to accurately estimate tumor perfusion rates from Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomographic (DCE-MSOT) images. The proposed methods are validated in-silico using inverse crime studies. We also demonstrate the efficacy of these methods using in-vivo data, by achieving a 3x reduction in computational costs for the same level of accuracy compared to the current state-of-the-art methods.

I presented this [work](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/13412/134120I/A-low-rank-based-image-reconstruction-method-for-dynamic-contrast/10.1117/12.3047128.full) at the [SPIE](https://spie.org) Medical Imaging Conference, 2025 at San Diego.
