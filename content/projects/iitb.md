I obtained a Bachelor's and Masters of Technology from IIT Bombay in Energy Science and Engineering. Whiel meeting my degree requirements, these are some of the projects I did:

- **A 3D Model of a Vanadium Redox Flow Battery (VRFB) electrode**, Master's thesis with Prof Dayadeep Monder. More on that [here]({{< relref path="./vrfb.md" >}}).
- **Solar tracker** (Guide: Prof.Chetan Solanki [Jan ‘15 - Apr ‘15]): 
Designed a solar tracking device to measure intensities at different angles to maximise intensity at a given time
- **Morse code bot** (Guide: Prof. Kavi Arya, CSE, IITB [Jan ‘15 - Apr ‘15]):
Using C++, programmed an Atmega bot to move in the direction based on the instructions in Morse code
